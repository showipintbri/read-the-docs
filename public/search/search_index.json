Dictionaries Dictionaries are a data structure made up of ' keys ' and ' values ' created with the use of curly-braces ' {} ' in Python. Rules: Keys must be unique. If a Key needs more than 1 Value, you must use a list, nested dictionary, tuple or other iterable. Create a Dictionary Before you can replace, update or delete any keys or values you must instantiate the dictionary. Empty dictionary: my_dict = {} Or instantiate with keys and values: my_dict = {'key1': 'value1'} or my_dict['key1'] = 'value1' You can call the object directly or print the dictionary: >>> my_dict = {'key1': 'value1'} >>> my_dict {'key1': 'value1'} Using print() : >>> my_dict = {'key1': 'value1'} >>> print(my_dict) {'key1': 'value1'} Add Key & Value to Existing Dictionary Key must be unique If Key is not unique Value will be overwritten. Start with a dictionary >>> my_dict = {'key1': 'value1'} >>> my_dict {'key1': 'value1'} Create a new Key with Value >>> my_dict['key2'] = 'value0' >>> my_dict {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value0'} Update the Value for existing Key (overwrite) >>> my_dict['key2'] = 'value1' >>> my_dict {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value1'} Add multiple Values to Key Because a Value is a single object, I commonly use list's when I need a Key to contain multiple Values.
